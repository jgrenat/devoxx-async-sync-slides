Devoxx France 2016 template

### What is this repository for? ###

This repository contains different templates for Devoxx France 2016. It's not a closed repository, you can also contribute and propose your presentation.

As an inspiration, we included a PDF version of our Keynote template, so that you can get an idea of what it could looks like.

### How do I contribute ###

If you want to create your own Devoxx France 2016, we'd like that you use our guidelines, fonts and logo so that we can offer a consolidated experience to our attendees.

### Devoxx France 2016 Fonts and Colors

### Fonts

#### Titles

For main title, we used Montserrat (https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Montserrat) 
You can use Montserrat semi-bold for titles.
See the Devoxx France web site as a live version. 

#### Main text

For main text we use Open Sans, one of the Google Font, with variant Normal, 400

### What is the Devoxx France 2016 Theme? ### 

Gears, gears, gears.

From the sponsor brochure to our web site, through the tee-shirt, we created a new theme around Gears. For French, the tagline will be "L'ensemble de nos passions". You can try to translate this to "The sum of all our passions".

### What is the recommended format? ### 

Almost all presentations are recorded. Your presentation will be available few weeks after Devoxx France 2016 on the Youtube Devoxx channel. 

We recommend that you keep the 16/9 ratio format for optimal display.

This year we record your laptop video output directly and thus we won't need PDF or your slides after the presentation. Feel free to use any presentation technologies, but try to follow our guidelines and the color chart.

Thanks
